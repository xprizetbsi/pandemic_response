    PARAMETERS
     - number_of_particles:       Number of particles in filter
     - number_of_iterations:      Number of iterations in filter
     - initial_particle_x_range:  Initial x range for particles
     - initial_particle_y_range:  Initial y range for particles
     - initial_object_location:   Initial location of object
     - object_location_change:    Change in object location per step
     - sensor_std:                Standard deviation for sensor
     - particle_std:              Standard deviation for particles
        
    DESCRIPTION
    A particle filter created to estimate the location of 
    an object with linear motion. There is uncertainty in 
    the system behaviour when we move the particles and 
    there is uncertainty in the sensor when we measure
    the distance between particles and the object.
